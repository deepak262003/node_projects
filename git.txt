.gitignore -file for ignoring unwanted folders by source control
- initializing git repo - #git init

-Add your project files to the Git repository. You can either add individual files or add all files in the current directory recursively:

#git add .    // Add all files recursively
#git add file1.js file2.js    // Add individual files

-Commit the changes with a descriptive commit message:

#git commit -m "Initial commit"
- In Git, the -m flag is used with the git commit command to specify a commit message directly on the command line.

Create a new repository on a Git hosting service, such as GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.
 Follow the instructions provided by the hosting service to create an empty repository.

 Set the remote repository URL as the origin for your local repository:

 #git remote add origin <repository-url>
 - In Git, a remote is a reference to a remote repository. 
 - A remote repository is a version of your Git repository that is hosted on a different machine or server.
 - In Git, "origin" is a common naming convention for the default remote repository.

 Push the commits to the remote repository:

#git push -u origin master
- In Git, the -u flag is used with the git push command to set the upstream branch for the current branch. 
- It associates the current branch with a remote branch and sets it as the default remote branch for future git push commands.
