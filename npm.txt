In Node.js and npm , dev dependencies refer to the packages that are necessary during the development and testing of a project 
but are not required in the production environment.

- Dev dependencies typically include tools, libraries, or testing frameworks that help with tasks such as code linting, unit testing, building, and development workflow. 
- They are used by developers to improve productivity and ensure code quality during the development process.
- Dev dependencies are specified in the devDependencies section of the package.json file for a Node.js project. 
# run npm install with the --dev or -D flag, npm installs only the dependencies specified in the devDependencies section.
